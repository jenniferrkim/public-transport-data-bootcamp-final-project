Project Description

**Principal Investigator: Jennifer Kim**

This project will study what effects changes on NYC Public Transportation. There are several considerations, including the introduction of Uber, population, and weather. It is easy to believe that there are obvious patterns (more Uber, less public transportation; more population, less usage; bad weather, less usage), but I am interested in exploring this further. 

The key element of the project is the use of datasets from the [New York Metropolitan Transportation Council](https://www.nymtc.org/DATA-AND-MODELING//Transportation-Data-and-Statistics/Publications/Travel-Patterns). This dataset provides usage data over many years. I will be using ridership totals across the following categories: MTA Rail, Buses, Port Authority, and NJ Transit. I will also be using Q1-4 from the years of 2008-2017. 

I also use population data from  weather data from the U.S. Census, and weather data from: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/toddwschneider/nyc-taxi-data/master/data/central_park_weather.csv
